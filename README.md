# UNet-for-cross-sequence-MR-image-translations
In this studt, we assessed the standard U-Net for end-to-end image translations across three MR image contrasts for the brain. 

# Availability of data and materials
The datasets analyzed during the current study are available in the BRATS 2018 challenge repository at https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html.
